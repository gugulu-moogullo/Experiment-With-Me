    First-Two-Slides (The Opening-Section) (Avantika Kanwar and Chandan Sharma)
        Slide-One: Chandan Kumar
            Good morning everyone! I'm Chandan Kumar, and I'm excited to present our solution for problem statement
            1672-Developing a machine-learning based solution to refine Captcha-systems.
        Slide-Two: Avantika Kanwar
            Thank you Chandan. I'm Avantika Kanwar. Our team has decided to develop an Intelligent behavioral Machine
            Learning Model that authenticates users by analyzing their behavioral patterns instead of relying on
            visual patterns. Now let me hand over to Gauransh and Bhavesh to explain our technical approach.


    Next-Two-Slides (The Middle-Part) (Gauransh Rajoria and Bhavesh Kanwar)
        Slide-Three:Gauransh Rajoria
            Thank you Avantika. I'm Gauransh Rajoria. Let me walk you through our Technical Architecture and
            Implementation. We're basically using --
                React with TypeScript and TailWind-CSS for frontend development, also for responsive UI.
                Node.js with FastAPI for our backend services and session management.
            There are also some other components like MongoDB for database management, and more, as you can see in
            our current slide.
        Slide-Four: Bhavesh Sharma
            Thank you Gauransh. I'm Bhavesh Sharma and let me address our Feasibility Analysis and Challenge
            Mitigation.
                As you can see here, our project will do real-time behavioral analysis using machine learning that
                adapts to user behavior over time.
                We will also ensure data privacy and security by anonymizing user data and complying with data
                protection regulations. There're multiple things that we've included in our slide, just to give you
                a proper analysis and solutions for the challenges that we might face. Like, the proper Model
                Accuracy, Efficient performace, Scalability, and User Experience.

    Last-Two-Slides (The Closing-Section) (Rohit Choudhary and Komal Shekhawat)
        Slide-Five: Komal Shekhawat
            Thank you Bhavesh. I'm Komal Shekhawat and let me highlight the Impact and Benefits of our solution.
            Our solution will target a significant user base, including Citizens, Government, and also Developers.
            On top of that, it will enhance security by reducing the risk of automated attacks and fraud. Also, our
            solution also aligns with UIDAI technical specifications and privacy policies.
        Slide-Six: Rohit Choudhary
            So, what we are building, I'm the leader of this team, Rohit Choudhary and we're a building a piece of software
            that basically include multiple-components, like a JavaScript Library (For the core behavioral system),
            A plugin architecture to integrate with existing systems and A demo website to showcase the functionality.

            For UIDAI Security: It's going to be a pluggable security module that government websites can integrate
            to their existing authentication flows to protect APIs and forms.
            Currently, we've also tested the Behavior-Tracker-Testing-System, that can do real-time tracking of the
            components like Mouse Movements, Keystrokes Dynamics, Touch Dynamics, and more.

            Here are the whole predicted directories that we've estimated to build this project...

1. UIDAI Full-form: Unique Identification Authority of India.
2. APIs: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software
applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. Instead of needing to know the internal workings of another
system.
3. Why traditional Captcha-systems are not enough?
    a. They can be easily bypassed by advanced bots using machine learning techniques.
    b. They often frustrate users, leading to a poor user experience.
    c. They may not be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
4. Behavioral Patterns: Behavioral patterns refer to the unique ways in which individuals interact with digital systems.

5. Why our project makes sense?
    a. Enhanced Security: By analyzing behavioral patterns, our system can more accurately distinguish between humans and bots.
    b. Improved User Experience: Users won't have to deal with frustrating Captcha challenges, leading to a smoother interaction.
    c. Accessibility: Our solution is designed to be inclusive, ensuring that all users can access online services without
       barriers.

5. Full-form of CAPTCHA: Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.

6. Uniqueness of our project:
    a. Behavioral Analysis: Unlike traditional Captcha systems that rely on visual challenges, our solution focuses on
       analyzing user behavior, making it more difficult for bots to mimic human actions.
    b. Machine Learning Integration: Our system continuously learns and adapts to new behavioral patterns, enhancing its
       effectiveness over time.
    c. Privacy Considerations: We prioritize user privacy by anonymizing data and ensuring compliance with data protection
       regulations.
