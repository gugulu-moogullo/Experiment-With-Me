Rohit Choudhary (Team-Leader): Introduction-
    Good-morning everyone, my name is Rohit Choudhary, and I'm the team-leader for team ThePrimeagen, and I'm handling the
    complete development. We're here to present.
    Our project called, An-Intelligent-Behavioral Machine-Learning Model that refines Captchas. Our project addresses
    problem statement ID-1672, which focuses on developing a machine-learning based solution to refine Captchas. This
    falls under the theme of Cybersecurity, Authentication and Smart-Automation.
        Now, let me introduce our Co-Leader of the team, Komal Shekhawat.And she's handling the workflow and deadlines
        for ourteam.
Komal Shekhawat (Team's Co-Leader): Talks about the problem and it's solution-
    Thank-you Rohit, so the core-issues that we're tackling is the accessibility problems caused by traditional-captchas,
    such as those that require annoying visual-patters, and those things are very unproductive.
        Our solution proposes an Machine-Learning powered authentication system that analyzes user behavioral patterns,
        like mouse movements, keystrokes, typing-speed, to verify a user's identity.
            This approach aims to reduce user-friction while maintaining high-security standards and eliminating
            the accessibility issues often faced with traditional-captchas.

        [Slide-Three:(Frontend/Backend Development)]+[Slide-Four:(Potential Changes and Processes)]
Gauransh Rajoria (Frontend-Developer): Now, Gauransh and Bhavesh will present the Development-Portion and the processes.
    Hello, I'm Gauransh Rajoria, and I've led the Frontend-Development. For our prototype, we've chosen React with
    TypeScript for it's Scalability, and TailWind-CSS to create a modern and accessible user interface.
        This architecture is designed to be pluggable, meaning it can be seamlessly integrated into existing we-services
        through RESTful API.
Bhavesh Sharma (Backend-Developer): With Gauransh
    Hello everyone, my name is Bhavesh Sharma and I'm the Backend-Developer. Our backend is built with either Node.js
    or Python FastAPI for high performance and efficiency. We're also using Redis for session management, and our
    databases are MongoDB for storing behavioral patterns and PostSQL for user data.
        We will also ensure data-privacy-and-security by anonymizing user data and complying with data protection
        regulations.

    Slide-Four and Slide-Five (Avantika Kanwat and Chandan Kumar)
    Position: Avantika Kanwar, Chandan Kumar-(Manages the Research/Analytics Sections)

        [Slide-Five:(Chandan Kumar)]+[Slide-Six:(Avantika Kanwar)]
Chandan Kumar: With Avantika Kanwar
    Hello everyone, I'm Chandan Kumar, one of the researchers on this project. Our solution is build on a foundation
    of extensive research into behavioral biometrics and existing frameworks. We're focusing on creating a privacy-first
    approach that is compliant with UIDAI data-protection policies and other standards like GDPR.
        We're also mitigating potential challenges, such as balancing accuracy and security, by using continous model
        retraining with fedrated learning and user-inputs.
Avantika Kanwar: WIth Chandan Kumar
    I'm Avantika Kanwar, the second researcher. Our analysis shows significant benefits and mesurable outcomes. To
    validate our approach, we conducted a user-survey, and the results have been over-whelm-ingly positive. The feedback
    shows a strong preference for our non-intrusive method over traditional Captchas.
        For citizens, our solution offers a seamless and accessible authentication experience, it basically increases
        the user-satisfaction and shapes the user-experience.

Chandan Kumar (Again): After Avantika
    So, for government and industry, it provides enhanced security for critical digital-services and a projected
    60-percent reduction in authentication time.
        Our system aims for a bot detection accuracy of over 95-percent with minimal false positives.
