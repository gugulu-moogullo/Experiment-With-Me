Analysts and Researchers are more important then developers, because they actually know, what a user truly wants, for
example, see Windows-Operating-System, if they've got some Analysts and Researchers, I would stilluse Windows. And here
I am, booting the Arch-Linux.

    For Avantika-Kanwar/Chandan-Kumar
---If I talk about the survey here. To validate the need for our project, we conducted a survey to understand user
   sentiment about traditional CAPTCHAs.
---Our findings revealed significant user dissatisfaction. As you can see from this chart, a combined 83.3% of
   respondents described their experience with traditional CAPTCHAs as either 'very frustrating' or 'frustrating.'
---The survey also highlighted the most frustrating aspects: 50% found 'solving visual puzzles' the most frustrating
   part, and 24.1% were frustrated by 'typing distorted text correctly.'
---These results clearly demonstrate a major pain point and a strong market need for a better solution.

    For Chandan-Kumar/Avantika-Kanwar
---Building on those findings, we presented our solution, the behavioral CAPTCHA, and asked for user feedback.
---The results were overwhelmingly positive. When asked to rate the user experience of a system that works in the
   background, over 69% of respondents rated it as 'Good' or 'Excellent.'
---We also learned that our approach to offering a behavioral challenge like a drag-and-drop puzzle is more engaging.
---The survey shows that 48.1% of users found a behavioral challenge to be 'much more engaging' than a traditional
   CAPTCHA.
---This data proves that our project not only solves a critical problem but also provides a user experience that
   people genuinely prefer. These results provide strong evidence for the real-world viability and positive social
   impact of our project.
